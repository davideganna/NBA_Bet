# NBA Bet üèÄ

NBA Bet is an experimental software which aims at predicting the outcome of NBA games by the utilization of ML (and non-ML) models. 
After a result has been predicted, NBA Bet reaches a bookmaker of choice (currently testing with *Bwin*) to get the odds for the predicted match.

The software is suitable for running continuously (e.g., by running it on a Raspberry Pi) and features a [telegram integration module](https://github.com/davideganna/NBA_Bet/blob/main/NBABet/telegram_integration.py) which can be used to get notified if a particular match is profitable.

## Main structure

#### A few notes regarding ```Setup.py```:
In its current version, running ```Setup.py``` is not needed if the project has been cloned from https://github.com/davideganna/NBA_Bet.git. When cloned this way, all the datasets are included and can be found in the ```past_data``` folder. However, when the 2021-2022 NBA season will start, running ```Setup.py``` will be needed.
