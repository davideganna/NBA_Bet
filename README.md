# NBA Bet üèÄ

NBA Bet is an experimental software which aims at predicting the outcome probability of NBA games by the utilization of ML (and non-ML) models.
After a result has been predicted, NBA Bet reaches a bookmaker of choice (currently testing with *SkyBet*) to get the odds for the predicted match.

The software is suitable for running continuously (e.g., by running it on a Raspberry Pi) and features a [telegram integration module](https://github.com/davideganna/NBA_Bet/blob/435dd874b8ccd60744a2b51cdb09f1aa9bfe320e/NBABet/telegram.py) which can be used to get notified if a particular match is profitable.

But what does _profitable_ mean?

## Mathematical foundations behind match profitability: Introducing EV
The Expected Value (EV) of a bet can be found as:

**EV = P(X) &middot; [Bet<sub>am</sub> &middot; (Odds-1)] - [1-P(X)] &middot; Bet<sub>am</sub>**

Where:

P(X) is the probability that an event occurs (returned by NBA bet);

Bet<sub>am</sub> is the amount of money invested;

Odds are the odds of that event (returned by the bookmaker).

####

The result obtained after the computation of the above formula is the expected gain/loss of the bet. An example follows:

Consider a NBA match between _HomeTeam_ and _AwayTeam_, where NBA bet returned a probability of _HomeTeam_ winning equal to 0.75, and the odds offered by a particular bookmaker are 1.38. With this information, if we choose to bet 100$ on the said match, the EV of the bet is:

EV = 0.75 &middot; (100$ &middot; 0.38) - 0.25 &middot; 100$

EV = 3.5$

Thus making the bet +EV, or _profitable_.

### A shortcut for calculating EV

It can be shown that the EV of a bet can be quickly calculated as the reciprocal of the probability of an event being lower than the odds offered by the bookmaker. Any bet that satisfies this criterion, has a positive EV. In the example above, 1/0.75 = 1.333 is less than 1.38, therefore fulfilling the criterion.

## How much should I bet?
The optimal bet amount is a function of the probability of the event occurring, the odds of the event and the available bankroll. It takes the name of _Kelly's criterion_, and can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion).

## Main structure

### Best Hyperparameters Selection (latest software version)
The simulated results from NBA Season 2020 can be found below:
```
Random Forest (500 trees) + Elo

leave_out = '2020'
margin = 0
betting_limiter = True
betting_limit = 0.125
prob_threshold = 0.65
prob_2x_bet = 0.8
average_N = 3
skip_n = 0

Net return per ‚Ç¨: 2.10

```

The simulation combines a 500-tree RF model stacked with an Elo model to bet only on matches predicted by both models. Bets amount are found using Kelly's criterion, with an initial bankroll of 100‚Ç¨.
